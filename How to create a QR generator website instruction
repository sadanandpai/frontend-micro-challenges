Creating a full-fledged website with a QR code generator is a substantial project that requires web development skills and knowledge of programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly backend technologies. Below, I'll provide a simplified outline of how you can create a basic QR code generator website. Keep in mind that this is a high-level overview, and you may need to dive deeper into web development and programming to build a fully functional website.

Here are the general steps to create a QR code generator website:

1. **Plan Your Website:**
   - Define the purpose and features of your QR code generator website.
   - Decide on the technologies you want to use for both the frontend and backend (e.g., HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Node.js, Python, etc.).

2. **Domain and Hosting:**
   - Purchase a domain name for your website (e.g., www.qrgenerator.com).
   - Choose a web hosting service to host your website files and databases.

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Create the user interface (UI) for your QR code generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Design the layout and appearance of the website.
   - Include a form where users can input their data (e.g., text, URL, contact information) for the QR code.

4. **QR Code Generation:**
   - Integrate a QR code generation library or API into your website's frontend code. Popular libraries include QRCode.js or qrcode-generator.
   - Use JavaScript to generate the QR code based on the user's input.

5. **Backend Development (Optional):**
   - If you want to store user-generated QR codes or provide additional functionality, you can create a backend using a programming language like Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.
   - Set up a server to handle user requests, process data, and serve the QR codes.

6. **QR Code Display:**
   - Display the generated QR code on the website for users to download or use.
   - Add functionality to allow users to customize the appearance of the QR code (e.g., colors, sizes).

7. **Testing:**
   - Test your website thoroughly to ensure that the QR code generation and other features work correctly.

8. **Security:**
   - Implement security measures to protect your website from potential threats and vulnerabilities, especially if you're storing user data.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy your website to your chosen hosting server and make it accessible on the internet.

10. **Domain Configuration:**
    - Configure your domain name to point to your hosting server's IP address.

11. **Maintenance and Updates:**
    - Regularly update your website, monitor for issues, and implement improvements based on user feedback.

Remember that building a website with a QR code generator involves a mix of frontend and backend development skills. If you're not experienced in web development, you may want to consider hiring a developer or team to help you with this project. Additionally, you should be aware of privacy and legal considerations when collecting and processing user data on your website.
